    <string name="introduce_custom_pic_api_content">\n⚠️ Note: <b>This is an advanced feature that requires you to have basic API call knowledge.</b>\n\n<big>1. Basic Description</big>\nThis feature allows you to configure your own <b>image translation API</b>, supporting both GET and POST request methods. (For image translation, the POST Content-Type can be either application/json; charset=utf-8 or multipart/form-data. Simply select the appropriate Content-Type in the dropdown menu, and there’s <b>no need</b> to explicitly add it to the request headers below.) All API responses must be in JSON format.\n\n<big>2. Usage Scenarios</big>\nTypically, major translation API providers implement their own signature algorithms, making it impossible to integrate via simple GET/POST requests. As such, the practical use case for the custom image translation API is to connect with a translation API interface that you’ve built yourself.\n\n<big>3. Parameter Description</big>\n1、Request Method: Can be either GET or POST.\n2、Content-Type (POST only): Can be application/json or multipart/form-data.\n3、Base URL: Can specify http or https. If no scheme is specified, the default is https.\n4、Query Parameters (GET only): Parameters appended to the base URL.\n5、Request Headers: Headers sent with the request.\n6、Request Body (POST only): Content included with the request.\n7、JSON Response Path: Path to retrieve the translation result from the API response JSON.\n\nNote:\n1、In \"Query Parameters\" and the request body with Content-Type set to application/json, <b>use \"useimgbase64\" to represent the image file to be translated</b>.\n2、In the request body with Content-Type set to multipart/form-data, <b>use \"useimgfile\" to represent the image file to be translated</b>.\n3、Additionally, ensure that both \"source language\" and \"target language\" codes are included in the \"Query Parameters\" or \"Request Body.\"\n\n<big>4. Request Examples</big>\n<b>GET Request</b>\nBase URL:\nhttps://api.example.com/translate\n\nQuery Parameters:\nKey: img, Value: useimgbase64\nKey: source, Value: ja\nKey: target, Value: zh\n\nRequest Headers:\nAuthorization = my_custom_token\n\n<b>POST Request</b>\nContent-Type:\napplication/json\n\nBase URL:\nhttps://api.example.com/translate\n\nRequest Headers:\nAuthorization = my_custom_token\n\nRequest Body:\nKey: img, Value: useimgbase64\nKey: source, Value: ja\nKey: target, Value: zh\n\n<b>POST Request</b>\nContent-Type:\nmultipart/form-data\n\nBase URL:\nhttps://api.example.com/translate\n\nRequest Headers:\nAuthorization = my_custom_token\n\nRequest Body:\nKey: img, Value: useimgfile\nKey: source, Value: ja\nKey: target, Value: zh\n\n<big>5. JSON Response Path</big>\n<b>Example 1:</b>\nSuppose the successful JSON response is as follows:\n\n{\n    \"code\": 0,\n    \"msg\": \"success\",\n    \"data\": {\n        \"translation\": \"Hello World\"\n    }\n}\n\nThen the JSON response path should be: \"data.translation\".\n\n<b>Example 2:</b>\nSuppose the successful JSON response is as follows:\n\n{\n    \"code\": 0,\n    \"msg\": \"success\",\n    \"result\": \"Hello World\"\n}\n\nThen the JSON response path should be: \"result\".(Excludes \".\")\n\n<big>6. Before Using This Feature</big>\nYou can first test the API response using tools like Postman or Reqable. Once the tests are successful, you can enter the relevant parameters into this feature.</string>

Basic Description</big>\nThis feature allows you to configure your own <b>text translation API</b>, supporting both GET and POST request methods. (For text translation, the POST Content-Type must and can only be application/json; charset=utf-8. There’s <b>no need</b> to explicitly add it to the request headers, as it’s already preset.) All API responses must be in JSON format.\n\n<big>2. Usage Scenarios</big>\nTypically, major translation API providers implement their own signature algorithms, making it impossible to integrate via simple GET/POST requests. As such, the practical use case for the custom text translation API is to connect with a translation API interface that you’ve built yourself.\n\n<big>3. Parameter Description</big>\n1、Request Method: Can be either GET or POST.\n2、Base URL: Can specify http or https. If no scheme is specified, the default is https.\n3、Query Parameters (GET only): Parameters appended to the base URL.\n4、Request Headers: Headers sent with the request.\n5、JSON Request Body (POST only): JSON content included with the request.\n6、JSON Response Path: Path to retrieve the translation result from the API response JSON.\n\nNote:\n1、In \"Query Parameters\" and \"JSON Request Body,\" <b>use “usesourcetext” to represent the text to be translated</b>.\n2、Make sure to include both the \"source language\" and \"target language\" codes in the \"Query Parameters\" or \"JSON Request Body.\"\n3、Additionally, specify the \"source language\" in the main interface, as MoeTranslate requires the \"source language\" when performing OCR text recognition.\n\n<big>4. Request Examples</big>\n<b>GET Request</b>\nBase URL:\nhttps://api.example.com/translate\n\nQuery Parameters:\nKey: text, Value: usesourcetext\nKey: source, Value: ja\nKey: target, Value: zh\n\nRequest Headers:\nAuthorization = my_custom_token\n\n<b>POST Request</b>\nBase URL:\nhttps://api.example.com/translate\n\nRequest Headers:\nAuthorization = my_custom_token\n\nJSON Request Body:\nKey: text, Value: usesourcetext\nKey: source, Value: ja\nKey: target, Value: zh\n\n<big>5. JSON Response Path</big>\n<b>Example 1:</b>\nSuppose the successful JSON response is as follows:\n\n{\n    \"code\": 0,\n    \"msg\": \"success\",\n    \"data\": {\n        \"translation\": \"Hello World\"\n    }\n}\n\nThen the JSON response path should be: \"data.translation\".\n\n<b>Example 2:</b>\nSuppose the successful JSON response is as follows:\n\n{\n    \"code\": 0,\n    \"msg\": \"success\",\n    \"result\": \"Hello World\"\n}\n\nThen the JSON response path should be: \"result\".(Excludes \".\")\n\n<big>6. Before Using This Feature</big>\nYou can first test the API response using tools like Postman or Reqable. Once the tests are successful, you can enter the relevant parameters into this feature.</string>

    <string name="faq_q1">Why is my HarmonyOS version 3.0 or greater, but it still says that the Android version is too low?</string>
    <string name="faq_a1">This is due to the fact that after Huawei updated HarmonyOS (note that it is not HarmonyOS NEXT), its underlying Android API can no longer be visually visible to users. For <font color="#E25A5C">most newer</font> Huawei phones, HarmonyOS 2.0 supports Android 10 (API 29). HarmonyOS 3.0 is compatible with Android 12 (API 31). However, for some older Huawei models, although HarmonyOS 3.0 has been updated, the underlying Android API has not been updated, and the underlying Android version of some models is still Android 10. As a result, the <font color="#E25A5C">system still does not meet the requirements</font> of Android 11 (API 30) for this software. Here are some of the known models:\n\nEquipped with Kirin 980 and below models, such as mate20, P30, Nova 5, etc., HarmonyOS 3.0 corresponds to Android version 10 (API 29). The HarmonyOS 3.0 of these models is not really 3.0, and there are many missing features, but the main upgrades are: updating the version number, using the new theme of 3.0, and adding some small features that do not depend on Android 12.</string>
    <string name="faq_q2">Why do I have granted accessibility permissions, but the software still prompts that I have not obtained accessibility permissions?</string>
    <string name="faq_a2">This is due to <font color="#E25A5C">accessibility permissions being reclaimed by the system</font>; Accessibility is a very important permission in Android. Most Android-based systems will revoke accessibility privileges when you exit the software or shut down and restart it, also for security reasons (of course, this software is open source and does not collect any information from you).\n\nKnowing the reason, it is also very easy to solve. As long as the software homepage clicks on the \"? > find the step to grant accessibility permissions - > click \"Go to grant this permission\" - > find the software, then <font color="#E25A5C">turn off the accessibility permissions of the software, and re-grant</font> them.</string>

    <string name="faq_q3">Why did I click on the hoverball, but there was no translation result for a long time, and finally an error was reported?</string>
    <string name="faq_a3">This is most likely <font color="#E25A5C">due to poor internet connections</font>. Many waifu games need to use accelerators, but after using accelerators, it is relatively slow to access the domestic translation API. As a result, the translation will time out and errors will occur.\n\nAt this time, please <font color="#E25A5C">turn off your wifi, turn on the data data, and then speed up with the accelerator again</font>. At this point, you should be able to use the translation fluently. <font color="#E25A5C">There is no need to worry about data consumption</font>, generally speaking, when you use the translation mode of \"local OCR recognition + text translation\", the amount of traffic spent is minimal.</string>
